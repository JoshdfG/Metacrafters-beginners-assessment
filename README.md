MyToken Smart Contract
This Solidity smart contract, named MyToken, is a basic implementation of a token on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides functionalities for minting (creating) and burning (destroying) tokens. Below are the key details and usage instructions:

Contract Details
Token Name: META
Token Symbol: MTA
Total Supply: 0 (initialized to zero)
Smart Contract Functions:
mint Function:

Description: Mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
Parameters:
_address: The Ethereum address to which the new tokens will be assigned.
_value: The amount of tokens to mint.
Behavior: Increases the total supply and adds the minted tokens to the balance of the specified address.
burn Function:

Description: Burn (destroy) existing tokens from a specified address.
Parameters:
_address: The Ethereum address from which tokens will be burned.
_value: The amount of tokens to burn.
Behavior: Checks if the specified address has enough tokens to burn. If yes, decreases the total supply and deducts the burned tokens from the address balance.
How to Use:
Minting:

Call the mint function, providing the recipient's address (_address) and the number of tokens to mint (_value).
Example: mint(<recipient_address>, <amount>)
Burning:

Call the burn function, providing the address from which to burn tokens (_address) and the number of tokens to burn (_value).
Example: burn(<address_to_burn_from>, <amount>)
Important Notes:
This is a simple token contract and does not include features like access control, events, or security considerations.
Be cautious while using the mint and burn functions to avoid unintended consequences.
Ensure proper access control mechanisms are implemented in a real-world scenario.
